Detailed Overview of Each Module
Module 1: Introduction to Deep Learning
This module introduces the core concepts of deep learning, covering the basic structure of deep neural networks (DNNs), and the role of activation functions, optimizers, and loss functions in training these models.

Module 2: Introduction to Neural Networks
Here, we dive deeper into the structure of neural networks, focusing on concepts such as neurons, layers, backpropagation, and gradient descent, along with building simple neural networks from scratch.

Module 3: Introduction to NN Frameworks
This module covers how to implement neural networks using popular frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras. It provides an introduction to their APIs and how they facilitate the creation and training of neural networks.

Module 4: Introduction to Fully Connected Neural Networks
The focus of this module is on fully connected neural networks (FCNNs). It demonstrates how to design and implement these networks for various tasks, including classification and regression.

Module 5: Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are introduced in this module. The assignment involves building CNN models for image recognition tasks, understanding the importance of convolution layers, pooling layers, and how CNNs excel at feature extraction in image data.

Module 6: Post Modelling Activities
This module involves activities that come after training a model, such as evaluating model performance, hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and dealing with overfitting using techniques like dropout and regularization.

Module 7: Learning from Pre-Built Models
Here, the assignment focuses on leveraging pre-built and pre-trained models for transfer learning. It provides hands-on practice in fine-tuning models like VGG, ResNet, etc., for specific tasks to save time and improve accuracy.

Module 8: Recurrent Neural Networks
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are explored in this module, with a focus on their ability to process sequential data. The assignment involves building and training RNNs for tasks like time series forecasting and text generation.

Module 9: Introduction to NLP
This module provides an introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP), including text preprocessing, tokenization, embeddings (like Word2Vec), and building simple NLP models for tasks such as sentiment analysis.
